## Instructions for playing the game
Run the program on a local server. The music wonâ€™t play if the index.html file is run locally.

Use the following commands to run the program on the local server.

If you have Python installed, it should be enough to run this from a command line (from your working directory):

1. For Python 2.x:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2. For Python 3.x:
python -m http.server

This will serve files from the current directory at localhost under port 8000, i.e in the address bar type:
http://localhost:8000/
